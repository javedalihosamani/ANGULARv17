ANGULAR LIFECYCLE HOOKS 
    -> Lifecycle hooks are a set of methods in Angular that are executed at specific moments during the lifecycle of a component. 

    -> These methods provide a way to tap into the Angular component lifecycle and perform custom logic or operations at specific points in time 

THERE ARE 8 LIFECYCLE HOOKS IN ANGULAR 
    1) ngOnChanges() :  This lifecycle hook is executed whenever the component's input properties change.

    2) ngOnInit() : This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's constructor method and is a good place to perform initial setup for the component.

    3) ngDoCheck() : This lifecycle hook is executed during every change detection cycle and is a good place to perform custom change detection.

    Note : Difference between ngDoCheck() and ngOnChanges()
        -> ngDocheck called every time when there is change detection cycle runs while ngOnChange only fire when there is a change in bound model property in component 

        -> ngDoCheck : this function will get called every single time an event has fired in the app that may cause a change, but not necessarily is considered a change.

        -> ngOnChanges : This will only and only get called if there has been a reference change in any of the @Inputs bindings, regardless of the ChangeDetectionStrategy of the component.
    
    4) ngAfterContentInit() : 
        -> This method runs after the first ngDoCheck() call.

        -> This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's content has been initialized and is a good place to perform additional setup for the component's content.

        -> Use ngAfterContentInit() to call something once after all of the content has been initialized.
    
    5) ngAfterContentChecked() : This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's content has been checked and is a good place to perform additional operations based on the component's content.
    
    6) ngAfterViewInit() : This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's view has been initialized and is a good place to perform additional setup for the component's view.
    
    7) ngAfterViewChecked() : This lifecycle hook is executed after the component's view has been checked and is a good place to perform additional operations based on the component's view.
    
    8) ngOnDestroy() : This lifecycle hook is executed just before the component is destroyed and is a good place to perform cleanup operations for the component.
