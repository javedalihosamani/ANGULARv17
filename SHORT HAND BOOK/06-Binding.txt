WHAT IS DATA BINDING IN ANGULAR?
    -> Allows an internet user to manipulate web page elements using a web browser.

    -> It employs dynamic HTML and does not require complex scripting orprogramming.

    -> Used in web pages that contain interactive components usuch as forms, calculators, tutorials and games.

TYPES OF DATA BINDING
    1) Interpolation and Property Binding 
        -> Interpolation is a technique that allows the user to bind a value to a UI element.

        -> Interpolation binds the data one-way.

        -> Property binding is a one-way mechanism that lets you set the Property of view element.

        -> Property binding uses [] sytax for data binding
        
        -> SYNTAX:
                        {{value}}       
            COMPONENTS ------------> DOM

    2) Event Binding 
        -> This data binding types is when information flows from the view to the component when an event is triggered

        -> The event could be a mouse click or akey press.

        -> The event is generally occurred due to user interaction.

        -> SYNTAX:
                      Event
            VIEWS ------------> COMPONENT

    3) Two way Binding
        -> Data flows from component to the view and back 

        COMPONENT <-------------> View 

        -> The component and view are always in sync and consistency is maintained

        -> This is typically used in forms where any changes need to be reflected in both the component and the view.
